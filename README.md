Welcome to Armor Restitched, a mod that reworks almost every aspect to do with armor and damage intake in Minecraft. Please report any technical issues you find here, while I ask you to make content-related feedback on the mod's CurseForge page.

This mod is licenced under the MIT License, feel free to adjust the mod according to your own personal tastes. However, I ask all references to the original mod be made back to the mod's CurseForge/Modrinth page, and please refrain from re-uploads with modifications. I also ask you to not distribute your personal adjustments of the mod without due credit to the original author.

There are mobs outside, let's get dressed for the occasion.
