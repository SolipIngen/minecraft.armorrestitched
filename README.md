Welcome to Armor Restitched, a mod that reworks almost every aspect to do with armor and damage intake in Minecraft. Please report any technical issues you find here, while I ask you to make content-related feedback on the mod's CurseForge page.

This mod is licenced under the MIT License, so feel free to adjust the code according to your own personal tastes.

I also ask you to not distribute your personal adjustments of the mod without due credit to the original author.

There are mobs outside, let's get dressed for the occasion.
